# Course Schedule

Teacher: Nicholas Sessa

Email: nicholas.sessa@gmail.com

Students are to read the chapter due for the week BEFORE class.  In addition to various activities and/or lecture, each class will include a review of the material that each student should have read during the previous week.  

**Materials Needed and Required for Each Class:**

Pencils with erasers (mechanical pencils are preferred since obtaining a working pencil sharpener can be challenging)
Notebook(s)
Bible (to be supplied)
Workbook (Be My Disciples - to be supplied)

Students are highly encouraged to read the Bible every day.  The USCCB (United States Conference of Catholic Bishops) provide daily readings for free here: http://www.usccb.org/bible/readings/

Students are also highly encouraged to write down any questions they have regarding the readings, church doctrine, history, or anything else relating to the faith and Church and I will do my best to answer them.
